Just messing around with love2d and learning Lua

## Dec 30, 2024 
I wanna make the game have a topdown view kinda like Stardew. I figured out the movement and now wanna add inventory and interacting with items. 
- [x] TODO: Fix code and implement better Lua/LOVE practices. 
- [ ] TODO: Fix the infinite running bug.
- [ ] TODO: Normalize horizontal movement.
- [ ] TODO: Figure out how the inventory system should work.
    - [ ] TODO: Create a random item and pick it up.
